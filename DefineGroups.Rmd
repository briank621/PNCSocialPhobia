## Include libraries

```{r}
require(data.table)
```
## Read data

Although the pncData contains over 8000 subjects, not all of them have brain imaging. We need to subset on those subjects who we have rsfmri data for.

```{r}
pncData = fread("scores/pyresult01_pnc_behav_mental4.csv")
allData = fread("scores/AllPreProcessed.csv")
subset = pncData[SUBJID %in% allData$SUBJID]
```

```{r}
sp = subset[smry_soc>=3&smry_mood_cat<=2&smry_eat_cat<=2&smry_gad<=2&smry_sep<=2&smry_phb<=2&smry_pan<=2&smry_agr<=2&smry_ocd<=2&smry_ptd<=2&smry_psy_cat<=2&smry_beh_cat<=2]
control = subset[Med_Rating<=1&smry_anx_cat<2&smry_mood_cat<2&smry_eat_cat<2&smry_pan<2&smry_agr<2&smry_ocd<2&smry_ptd<2&smry_psy_cat<2&smry_beh_cat<2]

combined = rbind(sp, control)
combined = combined[,.(bblid, SUBJID, Sex, age_at_cnb, smry_soc)]
```

```{r}
fwrite(combined, file="./scores/Groups.csv")
```
